# Step 3 in Building a Prompt Formula: Artistic Style

In art, style is all about how an artist blends techniques, processes, and choices uniquely. It's the special way an image is represented. These styles are usually linked to certain periods, movements, or individual artists. Each artistic style has its own standout features, making it different from the rest and adding to the diverse and rich tapestry of the art world.

## Artistic Styles for Diverse Art Forms
Some popular example for artistic styles are:

- **Realism, Realistic style**: A focus on mimicking the appearance and nature of the subject. It is recognizable by fine rendering, muted colors, intricate detail, and accurate fundamentals. Famous artists: Gustave Courbet, Jean-François Millet, Winslow Homer.
- **Romanticism, Romantic style**: It means capturing the subject in a favorable and exaggerated style.
Art in the romantic style is characterized by sharp contrast, bright highlights, strong colors, and a refined, almost
glossy finish.  Famous artists: Caspar David Friedrich, Eugène Delacroix, William Blake.
- **Abstract art**: A focus on capturing the subject in its simplest form. Think of abstract
as a scale rather than an absolute term. Essentially all artworks have some form of abstraction. Its characteristics are Reliance on shapes, colors, lines, and contrast. Famous artists: Wassily Kandinsky, Joan Miró, Piet Mondrian.
- **Impressionism**: Captures the artist's impression of a subject. It is recognizable by light colors, weak shadows, energetic brushwork, broken color, and colorful accents. Famous artists: Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas.
- **Photorealism**: It means capturing the subject with photographic accuracy. Photorealism is an art movement that seeks to replicate the look of real-life photographs through another medium. Charecteristics are meticulous drawing and detail. Famous artists: Chuck Close, Ralph Goings, Robert Bechtle.
- **Surrealism**: Surrealism is an art movement that explores the bizarre and dreamlike, creating images that defy reality and logic. It often features unexpected combinations, distorted forms, and a focus on the subconscious mind. Salvador Dalí and René Magritte are notable surrealistic artists.
- **Pop Art**: Pop art was a Western art movement that was popularized in The United States and Great Britain in the 1950s. Pop art – known for its bright, attention-catching colors – was used in advertising, merchandising, and graphic design during an era of rapid consumer growth. Famous artists: Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg.
- **Hyperrealism**: Hyperrealism is an art style that creates extremely realistic artworks, often indistinguishable from high-resolution photographs. Artists meticulously capture details to achieve a heightened level of realism. Famous artists: Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, Roberto Bernardi.

Yet, considering the significant variations within artistic styles, I've found that naming the artist is usually the wiser option. Instead of using "Abstract art" in your prompt, opt for an artist's name like "in the style of Kandinsky." The AI will then create an image mimicking the named artist's style. The artists' names don't have to exclusively be painters; they could include photographers like *Ansel Adams* or *Helmut Newton*, film directors such as *Wes Anderson* or *Tim Burton*, or even studios like *Studio Ghibli*, *Disney*, or *Pixar*.

You can combine and repeat elements, such as merging various artistic styles

## Artistic Styles for Photography

Within the [artistic medium](/02-prompt-formula-medium.md) of photography, there are distinct styles that deviate from the more general ones. Some prominent examples include:

- **Color Splash**: A technique where most of an image is in black and white, while a specific portion remains in color. This technique is used to draw attention to a particular subject or element within the photograph by isolating it in color against a monochromatic background. The term "color splash" is often associated with impactful and visually striking images where the selective use of color creates a focal point and emphasizes certain details.
- **Tilt Shift**: Tilt-shift is a photography technique that makes real scenes look like miniature models. It's achieved by adjusting the camera lens to control focus and perspective. This creates a shallow depth of field, making some parts blurry and giving the illusion of a tiny, toy-like world.
- **Monochrome**: Monochrome photography is a style where pictures are captured using shades of a single color, usually black and white or sepia. It creates a classic, timeless look by emphasizing light, shadow, and contrast without the distraction of multiple colors.
- **High-Speed Photography**: Captures rapidly occurring events, such as splashing liquids or fast-moving objects, by using high-speed shutter settings.
- **Long Exposure:** A photograph taken with a slow shutter speed, capturing motion blur in moving subjects or creating a smooth, flowing effect in water or clouds.
- **Double Exposure:** Double exposure is a photography technique where two different images are combined into a single frame. It creates a unique and artistic effect, blending elements from both images. This can result in surreal or ghostly visuals, as if two separate scenes are overlapping in one photograph.
