# Step 4 in Building a Prompt Formula: Aesthetics

Aesthetics encompass the attractiveness and style of artwork, taking into account aspects such as perspective, lighting, contrast, and mood. It involves skillfully combining these elements to evoke emotions, convey messages, and offer a visually pleasing experience for the viewer.

Our prompt formula can now be extended to:

```markdown
<Artistic medium> <Adjective> Subject <Action or Accessory> <Location> <Artistic style> <Aesthetics>
```

Let's break down some of the aesthetic elements that can impact image generation.

## Perspective
The perspective refers to the vantage point or viewpoint from which an image is observed or created. Here are some examples:

- **Linear Perspective:** Linear perspective is a technique in art and photography that makes things look three-dimensional on a flat surface. It uses converging lines that meet at a point on the horizon, creating a sense of depth and distance.

- **Aerial Perspective (Atmospheric Perspective):** Aerial perspective, also known as atmospheric perspective, is a technique in art and photography that shows depth by mimicking the way the atmosphere affects distant objects. It involves making distant objects appear lighter, less detailed, and bluer than closer ones. This technique creates a sense of distance and adds realism to the depiction of landscapes.

- **Fish-Eye view:** Using a fish-eye lens to capture a scene, resulting in a distorted, spherical view that includes a wide field of view.

- **Worm's Eye View:** Photographing or painting a subject from a low angle, as if seen from the ground, exaggerating the height and dominance of the subject.

- **Bird's Eye View:** Capturing a scene from a high angle, as if seen from above, providing an overview and emphasizing patterns or relationships between elements.

## Lighting

Lighting in images, whether in photography or paintings, refers to the deliberate use and manipulation of light to enhance visual impact. It shapes the mood, highlights details, and influences the overall atmosphere, contributing to the effectiveness and emotional resonance of the image. In paintings, artists use brushwork and color to simulate the effects of light, while in photography, the control of natural and artificial light sources is essential for achieving the desired aesthetic. These are some examples:

- **Natural Light / Ambient Light:** Illuminating a subject using ambient sunlight, providing a soft and natural look, often ideal for portraits taken outdoors.

- **Backlighting:** Positioning the light source behind the subject, creating a halo effect and emphasizing contours, often used for creating silhouettes.

- **Soft Light:** Achieving a gentle and diffused illumination, commonly from overcast skies or through a diffuser, resulting in soft shadows and even tones.

- **Artificial Light:** Using a direct and intense light source, such as the a neon or a spotlight, to create strong, defined shadows and highlights.


## Contrast

Contrast in images is the degree of difference between elements, such as light and dark, colors, or textures. It adds visual interest, emphasizes focal points, and creates a dynamic composition. Here are some examples:

- **High Contrast:** A photograph with stark black and white elements, creating strong visual impact and emphasizing sharp distinctions.

- **Low Contrast:** A painting with muted tones and subtle transitions between light and shadow, creating a softer and more subdued visual effect.

## Mood

The mood of an image refers to the overall emotional atmosphere it conveys. It can be described as:

- **Gloomy:** Eliciting a sense of darkness, sadness, or somberness.

- **Bright:** Radiating a cheerful and optimistic ambiance.

- **Vibrant:** Bursting with lively and intense colors, creating energy.

- **Dynamic:** Full of movement and action, conveying a sense of vitality.

- **Serene:** Calm, peaceful, and tranquil, inducing a sense of relaxation.

- **Mysterious:** Creating a sense of intrigue and curiosity, often with obscured or hidden elements.
  
- **Ethereal:** Evoking a delicate, otherworldly, or dreamlike feeling.
  
- **Nostalgic:** Stirring emotions associated with fond memories or the past.
  
- **Tense:** Generating a feeling of unease, anticipation, or suspense.
  
- **Whimsical:** Playful, lighthearted, and fanciful, often with a touch of fantasy.
  
- **Melancholic:** Reflecting a deep, thoughtful sadness or pensiveness.
  
- **Empowering:** Instilling a sense of strength, confidence, and inspiration.
  
- **Intimate:** Creating a personal and close connection, often in portraiture or close-up shots.
  
- **Surreal:** Exhibiting a dreamlike or fantastical quality that defies reality.
