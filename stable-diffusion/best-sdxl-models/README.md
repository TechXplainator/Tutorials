# Best SDXL Models

With thousands of Stable Diffusion models out there its hard to decide which one to use. Moreover, every model has its own speciality, so it can be a challenge to find the best ones for each use case. In this tutorial I’ll guide you through the top 5 models for each category.

If you prefer learning through a visual approach or want to gain additional insight into this topic, be sure to check out my YouTube video on this subject!

- [Dreamshaper XL](#dreamshaper-xl): **Best for Fantasy and Fiction** - The go-to choice for fans of fantasy, cyberpunk, and anime themes, offering specialized capabilities in these genres.
- [Juggernaut XL](#juggernaut-xl): **Best for Professional Photos** - Specializes in creating professional-quality, realistic photographs, ideal for polished and refined imagery.
- [RealVisXL](#realvisxl): **Best for Authentic Photos** - Centered on authenticity and realism, it stands out as the premier choice for users seeking to generate exceptionally realistic images that don't appear to be captured in a studio setting.

## Model Comparison

You can check out a comparison of images generated by these models [right here](/stable-diffusion/best-sdxl-models/sdxl-model-comparison.md) which includes all the prompts and settings I have used.

## SDXL 1.0

SDXL stands for "Stable Diffusion Extra Large," and it's the latest generation of base models provided by [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/). All the other models you'll see in this video were fine-tuned based  on this model to fit a particular style or use case.

[SDXL 1.0](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-sdxl-1-announcement) was trained on 1024 by 1024 images and delivers the best quality for these dimensions. It's a versatile model suitable for generating a wide range of content in high quality, even with simple prompts. 

Furthermore, SDXL 1.0 should work effectively on consumer GPUs with 8GB VRAM or readily available cloud instances.

The SDXL model consists of two parts: the base model and the refiner model. The base model determines the overall composition of the image, while the refiner model adds finer details and enhances visual fidelity. You can use the base model alone, which already produces excellent images, or combine it with the refiner model for even better results.

Stability AI introduced another model named [SDXL Turbo](https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-sdxl-turbo), which is significantly faster than SDXL 1.0 in creating images. However, **be careful!** As stated on the model's [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo), SDXL Turbo is currently available under a non-commercial research license, allowing for personal and non-commercial use only. Using images generated with this model for commercial purposes requires obtaining a model license from the developers. Keep this in mind if you are using your generated images for commercial purposes!

The SDXL models, both 1.0 and Turbo, come with certain limitations. Achieving flawless photorealism is beyond their capabilities, rendering legible text is a challenge, and complex tasks involving compositionality, like generating an image matching the description "A red cube on top of a blue sphere," can be problematic. Additionally, generating accurate faces and people might pose difficulties for these models.

Overall, the official SDXL 1.0 has been and continues to be among the top image generation models available.

### Model Page

- [SDXL 1.0 base model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0) offers a choice of two checkpoint files:
    - [sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors) is the original base model file for SDXL 1.0. Its a great model in its own right which produces amazing images. 
    - [sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors) is an updated file for SDXL 1.0 that comes pre-equipped with VAE. VAE stands for “Variational Autoencoder” and its a technique that can be used to improve hands and faces. It gives you higher quality images. If you use this checkpoint file, you don’t need to use any VAE separately, because this model already comes pre-equipped with one. 

- [SDXL refiner model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0) which also offers a choice of two checkpoint files:
    - [sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors] which is the original refiner model for SDXL 1.0, a great choice.
    - [sd_xl_refiner_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_refiner_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors) which has VAE included in it. So, this is the better choice.


**I recommend downloading the model checkpoints that include VAE.** So: 
- [sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_base_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors)
- [sd_xl_refiner_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_refiner_1.0_0.9vae.safetensors)


## Copax TimeLessXL - SDXL1.0

Copax TimeLessXL - SDXL1.0 prioritizes diversity in artistic styles over a singular focus. It aims to explore and incorporate a broad range of expressions, rather than confining creativity to one specific aesthetic, reflecting its training on SDXL 1.0.


Copax TimeLessXL stands out in this video for its ability to create captivating images with vivid colors and strong contrasts, pushing boundaries with surreal visuals. These images offer depth and intensity, providing an immersive viewing experience and establishing Copax TimeLessXL as a notable contender in image generation.

### Configuration Settings

## Dreamshaper XL 

Dreamshaper XL was initially developed to transform text, dreams, and descriptions into visually captivating representations. However, it has evolved into a versatile model designed to excel across various domains such as photos, art, anime, and manga.

There are two recent versions available: Alpha 2, which is built on Stability AI's SDXL 1.0 model, and the newer Turbo version, based on SDXL Turbo.

On the model page on Civitai, you can explore the different versions, and by clicking on a version, you can discover the base model it was trained on.

> **It's important to note that the Turbo version comes with restrictions on commercial use unless you obtain a model license from Stability AI.**

Dreamshaper XL eliminates the need for using a refiner. It demonstrates proficiency in generating both realistic and anime/illustration-style images. Additionally, the model is capable of generating NSFW images and is particularly well-suited for sci-fi and cyberpunk styles.

### Configuration Settings for the Turbo-Version

For the best results with the Turbo-Version, use the following configuration during image generation:

- **Sampler:** 
    - DPM++ SDE Karras
    - Do not use LCM sampler unless you need speed vs quality. 
- **Sampling Steps:** 4-8
- **CFG Scale:** 2

### Negative Prompt

Start with no negative prompt and then gradually add things you don't want to see in the image.
